# hatecrimes


A project analyzing hatecrime data before and after the 2016 elections in the United States. Following the data and analysis by FiveThirtyEight, I show that their model was highly influenced by an outlier and propose new methodologies to analyze the data.

The code-only file contains all the code needed to replicate the results in the final report, while the scripts file contains the implementation of additional models.
